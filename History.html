        <h2>Ancient Italy and the Roman Empire</h2>
        <p>
            Italy has one of the longest and most influential histories in the world.
            Long before Italy became a country, the land was home to ancient civilizations
            such as the Etruscans and Greeks. Around 753 BC, the city of Rome was founded,
            beginning the rise of one of the greatest empires in history.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Roman Empire controlled much of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.
            Romans built advanced roads, aqueducts, bridges, and cities that are still
            admired today. Roman ideas about government, law, language, and architecture
            continue to influence modern societies.

        <h2>The Fall of Rome and the Middle Ages</h2>
        <p>
            In 476 AD, the Western Roman Empire collapsed due to invasions, economic problems,
            and political instability. After the fall of Rome, Italy was divided into many
            smaller kingdoms and city-states.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the Middle Ages, cities like Venice, Florence, Milan, and Genoa became
            powerful trading centers. These city-states gained wealth through trade and
            banking, setting the stage for a cultural rebirth.

        <h2>The Renaissance</h2>
        <p>
            The Renaissance began in Italy during the 14th century and marked a revival of
            art, science, and learning inspired by ancient Greece and Rome. Italy became
            the cultural center of Europe.
        </p>
        <p>
            Famous artists and thinkers such as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo,
            Raphael, Galileo Galilei, and Dante Alighieri made groundbreaking contributions.
            Their work changed how people viewed art, science, and the human experience.

        <h2>Italian Unification</h2>
        <p>
            For many centuries, Italy remained divided. In the 1800s, a movement called
            the Risorgimento sought to unify the country. Important leaders like Giuseppe
            Garibaldi and Count Camillo di Cavour played key roles in this effort.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1861, Italy officially became a unified nation, with Rome becoming its capital
            in 1871. This marked the beginning of modern Italy.

        <h2>Modern Italy</h2>
        <p>
            In the 20th century, Italy experienced major changes, including participation
            in both World Wars. After World War II, Italy became a republic in 1946 and began
            rebuilding its economy and government.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, Italy is a democratic country known for its culture, history, fashion,
            art, and cuisine. It is a member of the European Union and remains one of the
            most visited countries in the world.
