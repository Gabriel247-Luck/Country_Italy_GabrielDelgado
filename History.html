    <h1> Pasta wasnt always made with tomatoes, in fact tomatoes arrived very late. </h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Tomatoes are native to the Americas and only reached Italy in the 16th century.
        For centuries before that, Italians ate pasta with cheese, pepper, or other
        sauces—no marinara in sight.

    <h1> Rome had a fire department… run by a private millionaire? </h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        In ancient Rome, Marcus Licinius Crassus—one of the richest men in history—
        created his own fire brigade. When a building caught fire, his team would show up
        and only put it out if the owner agreed to sell the property to Crassus at a
        discounted price.

    <h1> Venice once declared war on an entire sea. </h1>
    <hr>
    <p> Venice once symbolically declared war on the entire Adriatic Sea. In the early form of a ritual that later became the Marriage of the Sea ceremony, the Venetian Republic performed a public act meant to assert its dominance over the water after storms had damaged its ships. This evolved into the tradition where the doge threw a ring into the sea to show that Venice claimed authority over it. </p>
