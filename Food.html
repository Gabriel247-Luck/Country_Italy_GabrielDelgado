        <h2>Regional Cuisine of Italy</h2>
        <p>
            Italy is divided into different regions, and each region has its own distinct culinary traditions, flavors, and ingredients. The food in Northern Italy differs significantly from that in Southern Italy. In the north, you will find creamy risottos, butter-based sauces, and dishes that feature polenta—cornmeal cooked into a creamy texture. These foods are hearty and perfect for the colder climate.
            In Southern Italy, the food is more Mediterranean, with a strong focus on tomatoes, olive oil, garlic, seafood, and bold flavors. Fresh seafood is common in coastal areas, while inland regions feature more meat-based dishes, often with rich sauces. The diversity of ingredients across the regions makes Italian cuisine incredibly rich and varied, so theres always something new to try no matter where you go.
