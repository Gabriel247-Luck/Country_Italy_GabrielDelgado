            <hr>
            <p>
                Italian culture is deeply rooted in history, family values, art, and tradition.
                Daily life in Italy often revolves around food, social connections, and a strong
                appreciation for beauty and craftsmanship. These traditions have been shaped
                over centuries and continue to influence modern Italian life.

            <hr>
            <p>
                The passeggiata is a beloved daily ritual in Italy. In the evening, families,
                couples, and friends take a leisurely walk through town squares and streets.
                It is a time to socialize, relax, and enjoy the community atmosphere.

            <hr>
            <p>
                Coffee culture in Italy follows unwritten rules. Cappuccinos are traditionally
                enjoyed only in the morning, usually with breakfast. After meals, Italians
                prefer a small espresso, often enjoyed standing at a café bar.

            <hr>
            <p>
                "Bella figura" is an important Italian concept that means making a good
                impression through appearance, manners, and behavior. Italians value
                elegance, confidence, and respect in everyday life.
            </p>
            <p>
                This idea goes beyond clothing — it reflects how people speak, interact,
                and carry themselves with pride and dignity.

                A popular tradition in Rome is tossing a coin into the Trevi Fountain.
                Legend says that throwing one coin ensures a return to Rome. The money
                collected from the fountain is donated to charity.
