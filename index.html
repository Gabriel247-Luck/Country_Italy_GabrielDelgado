            Italy is a fascinating country located in Europe and is famously shaped like a boot.
            It is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea and is home to beautiful beaches, mountains,

            birthplace of the Renaissance, producing influential figures such as Leonardo da Vinci
            and Michelangelo.
